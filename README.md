### Usefull comands with make

After downloading a project, please type "make install" into a terminal for correct installing all modules.
Then, type a game, which you want to start. You should give correct answers 3 times.

Description of all games. Just type in the terminal next commands:

"brain-even" - will execute a game, where you will check a number is even or not.
"brain-calc" - a simple calculator.
"brain-gcd" - find the greatest common divisor of given numbers.
"brain-prime" - check the number is prime or not.
"brain-progression" - find a skipped number in the progression.

In the text below you can watch, how this program works.
